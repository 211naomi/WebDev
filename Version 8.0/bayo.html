        <h1>Bayonetta, The Umbra Witch</h1>
        <p>Brought into Smash 4 as a DLC Fighter, Bayonetta hails from her self titled games "Bayonetta" and "Bayonetta 2", in both her original games and Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, she is a heavily combo oriented fighter who uses many fast moves that can chain into other quick moves. Additionally, she can use "Witch Time" to slow down her opponents, as well as rack up damage with her bullet arts.</p>

<div class=content>
<p>Bayonetta's moves are heavily based around comboing into each other. Heel Slide (first picture) is one Bayonetta's most powerful set up tools, she slides across the ground and performs a kick, which is good at setting someone into the air to combo into another move. When used in the air, Heel Slide becomes Afterburner Kick (Picture 3) similar to Heel Slide's function on the ground, Afterburner Kick is an excellent choice for starting combos in the air. Other moves in Bayonetta's toolkit include Witch Twist (second picture) for continuing air combos, her smash attacks (picture 4) for finishing off opponents, and Witch Time (picture 5) for slowing down foes to more easily start combos or finish them</p>
