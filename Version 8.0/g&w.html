        <h1>Mr Game and Watch</h1>
        <p>Mr Game and Watch doesn't represent a single game, but an entire era of games called "Game and Watch Games" his moveset is heavily inspired by a multitude of these games, which is why Mr Game and Watch is a contender for one of the silliest characters in Smash</p>

<div class=content>
<p>The bread and butter of Game and Watch's kit is his Judge Attack, he swings a hammer and displays a number that is one through nine. Each of these numbers have varying effects, a 7 for example will do moderate damage and also spawn three healing items for Mr Game and Watch. However, the variants between one and nine are quite important. A one will damage Mr Game and Watch quite severely, leaving him open to KO's quicker. However, a 9 will instantly KO if it lands on a foe.</p>
