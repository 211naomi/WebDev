        <h1>Robert</h1>
        <p>While not having his own game, Rob is a part of Nintendo's pantheon as an accessory that game with their first game system the NES. Rob uses lasers and his rotating limbs to deliver a flurry of blows quickly. </p>

<div class=content>
<p>Rob doesn't have a game of his own to base his moves off of, Rob instead combines common robot tropes with his rotating limbs to perform powerful laser attack that can be angled to rack up damage. In addition, Rob's air game is some of the most deadly in the entire game, his aerials come out insanely fast and are incredibly hard to punish with consistency.</p>
