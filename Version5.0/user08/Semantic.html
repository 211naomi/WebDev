                <h2>Facts About Music</h2>
                <p>
                <p><b>Musicians Have Shorter Life Spans Than the General Population.</b> One study, conducted by a
                    University of Sydney professor, titled "Stairway to H*ll: Life and Death in the Pop Music Industry,"
                    examined the deaths of artists which took place between 1950 and June 2014. The study specifically
                    looked at longevity and the proportion of suicides, homicides, and accidental deaths. Longevity was
                    determined by calculating the average age of death for each musician by sex and decade of their
                    death. These averages were then compared with averages by sex and decade for the general U.S.
                    population. The results? Musicians' lifespans are 25 years shorter.</p>
                <p><b>Singing in a Group Boosts Mood.</b> Multiple studies have been conducted that prove singing as a
                    part of a group provides numerous physical and emotional benefits. Researchers have discovered that
                    singing is soothing and does indeed raise one's spirits and mood. When you sing with others, the
                    body releases feel-good hormones, like oxytocin, and reduces stress-causing ones, like cortisol.</p>
                <p><b>"Jingle Bells" Was Originally a Thanksgiving Song.</b> "Jingle Bells" is a Christmas classic, but
                    it didn't originate that way. Written by James Lord Pierpont and published in 1857, it was meant to
                    be sung during Thanksgiving. The song's original title was "One Horse Open Sleigh" then it was
                    changed to "Jingle Bells, or the One Horse Open Sleigh" when it was reprinted in 1859. There is a
                    plaque in Medford, Massachusetts, at the former site of a tavern, where the song is said to have
                    been written, in an area where, and an era when, sleigh races were popular.</p>
                <p><b>Music Affects Your Perception of the World.</b> A 2011 study conducted at the University of
                    Groningen showed that music not only affects mood, but it has an even more significant effect on
                    perception. Subjects who were tested were influenced by the music they heard, based on what they
                    saw; participants were asked to listen to music and identify corresponding smiley faces. Smiley
                    faces that matched the music were identified much more accurately. And even when no smiley face was
                    shown, the subjects thought they recognized a happy face when listening to happy music, and a sad
                    face when listening to sad music.</p>

                    Music Helps Plants Grow Faster. The study used 14 different classical pieces, including Beethoven's
                    "Moonlight Sonata," in rice fields. Findings were that the music helped the crops grow at a faster
                    pace, and pointed to evidence that plants have genes which enable them to "hear."
