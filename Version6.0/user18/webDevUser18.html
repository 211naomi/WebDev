<img src="ABC.png" alt="Ponzi Scheme" height= "200">
                    <h4> Charles Ponzi</h4>
<p> He is the lowest of the profiters on the list. Despite this he has developed a method that many today use. I put him on the list instead of the people who used his idea and made more than him. Basically he get's a couple people to pay him to start a new "buisness" or make a new "product" and then tells them they will get some money back after a while, but not the full amount. Then he gets some more people. Specifically more than the last group. He gets these guys into his "product." Then he takes the money from them, pays the people from earlier, and keeps all the extra. He then continues this process untill he runs out of people to convice into helping this "buisness." At this point it is most likley that he will take his cash and run.</p>
<h4> Abe Alizadeh</h4> 
<p>Way back in 2004, Abe Alizadeh owned the company Kobra Properties. What he did was he inflated the price of contracts in his company, sometimes to nearly double the price, in order to drive competition. he owned several Sonic drive-ins, a couple TGI Fridays and more than 70 Jack in the Boxes. Not much is n=known other than the fact that he engaged in illegal conduct on all of these properties, eaning his $23 million.</p>
<h4>Jeffery R. David</h4>
                    <p>He stole some money.</p>
