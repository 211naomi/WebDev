        <h2 id="gettoknowme2">Birth</h2>
        <section id="gettoknowme2">Martin Luther King was born in 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia. Along with his older sister
            Christine and younger
            brother Alfred Daniel Williams, he grew up in the city’s Sweet Auburn neighborhood, then home to some of
            the
            most prominent and prosperous African Americans in the country. A gifted student, King attended
            segregated public schools and at the age of 15 was admitted to Morehouse College, the alma mater of both
            his father and maternal grandfather, where he studied medicine and law.

            Although he had not intended to follow in his father’s footsteps by joining the ministry, he changed his
            mind under the mentorship of Morehouse’s president, Dr. Benjamin Mays, an influential theologian and
            outspoken advocate for racial equality. After graduating in 1948, King entered Crozer Theological
            Seminary in Pennsylvania, where he earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree, won a prestigious fellowship
            and was elected president of his predominantly white senior class.

            King then enrolled in a graduate program at Boston University, completing his coursework in 1953 and
            earning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later. While in Boston he met Coretta Scott, a
            young singer from Alabama who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music. The couple wed in
            1953 and settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.

            The Kings had four children: Yolanda Denise King, Martin Luther King III, Dexter Scott King and Bernice
            Albertine King</section>
