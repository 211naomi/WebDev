                    <p >At first I wasn't sure about the ULS, but when the IRS came for me because of
                        my blatant tax evasion and massive corperate fraud, I had no one else to turn to.

                    <p>When I first heard about the Underground Lawyer Society, I knew they were
                        the right ones for me, Rick Shane was excellent in his handling of my case, the prosecution
                        never had the chance for questioning because the judge had the case thrown out! Excellent 
                        job!!

                    <p>I never was fond of Donnie, but after Christina took over my case, she handled 
                        it like a true champion. After just 13 weeks, I was cleared of my charges of treason
                        and corperate espionage! Incredible service!

                    <p>I'm writing this from prison right now, Evan Pline did a great job on my
                        case! I only was sentenced to life + 200 years instead of getting
                        the death penalty! Completley pleased with my service and look forward 
                        to using the ULS in my upcoming cases!

                    <p>Simply incredible! I never expected to get away with tax fraud on the scale that I did, but with the ULS 
                        at my back I was able to get off with only a fine of $2.5 million and 1 year in a county jail! Simply 
                        unprecedneted results!!

                    <p>You never expect someone like Rick to be successful, he certianly just looked like a casual green lawyer to me,
                        but after he took the stand and began a furious line of questioning I was sure he was the one for me! I was able 
                        to avoid my sentencing all together thanks to him!

                    <p> Fraud, tax evasion, obstruction of justice, homicide. They were ready to throw the book at me for my crimes, 
                        but I had an ace up my sleve; Donnie! He didn't let the prosecution get a word out before objecting to the nonsesne 
                        they were about to spew! Even the judge was astonished with his ability to interrupt and object ot just about every 
                        sentence, phrase, or word that left their mouth! It made them think twice before speaking, and I ultimatley won!!
