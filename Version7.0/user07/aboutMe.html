    <h2>In this section I will talk (type) about myself.</h2>
    <p>School:I (at the time of writing this) am a Sophmore at Shakopee High School (This will be abbriviated as SHS
        from now on)
        most of my time of this school year has been spent at home because of Covid-19, hopefully this will change
        by the end of this year. </p>
    <p>Home:I live in Shakopee,Minnisota. I live with my parents, my younger brother, and my 3 cats.</p>
    <p>Hobbies:Some of my hobbies include making tank models (photos of them will be included), I am also a blue
        belt in Self Defense (Its basically a mixture of martial arts).
        I also like to play video games, mainly Escape From Tarkov (Will be refered to as Tarkov or EFT), And some
        virtual reality games, Pavlov and Hotdogs Horseshoes and Handgrenades.
    </p>

    <p>This is a KV-1 soviet tank model, it was first used in 1939, I could talk about tanks for hours on end but I
        want a good grade on this so ill just link to some places that talk about it.</p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov_tank">KV-1 on Wikipedia</a>
    <a href="https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/soviet/soviet_KV-1.php">KV-1 on the Tank Encyclopedia.</a>
    <p> I have also made other tank models, I will link to web pages talking about them here.</p>
    <p> The next tank is called the KV-2, basically a KV-1 with a really big gun. Personally, I think it looks
        funny.</p>
    <a href="https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/soviet/soviet_KV-2.php">This is the Tank Encyclopedia page for the
        KV-2, if you want to read about it on wikipedia, it is the same page as the KV-1</a>
    <p>This tank, the T-35 was special because it had more than one turret, in fact it had five! This tank is
        important to me because it is the first tank model I built.</p>

    <a href="https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/soviet/soviet_t-35.php">T-35 on The Tank Encyclopedia</a>
    <p>The last tank model I have built is a panzer 4 (or panzer IV), the model I made has add on armour, which help
        stop HEAT rounds.</p>
