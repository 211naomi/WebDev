    <h1><b>Elon Musk's Children</b></h1>
    <p>Musk's first child, Nevada Alexander Musk, was born in 2002, two years after he married Canadian author Justine
        Wilson in 2000. Sadly, he died at just 10 weeks old of sudden infant death syndrome.<span
            id="dots">..</span><span id="more"> In 2004, Musk and then-wife Justine welcomed twins Griffin and Xavier.
            The twins, who are now 17, were conceived through IVF. Very little is known about the boys. Musk shares
            custody of them with Justine. The former couple's triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian Musk were born in 2006.
            They too were conceived through IVF and custody is shared between the two parents, after they divorced in
            2008. The triplets are now 15. Musk has never spoken publicly about his life with his sons. In a previous
            interview, Wilson said: "Almost all of my non-work waking hours are spent with my boys, and they are the
            love of my life.” On May 5, 2020, Elon Musk and his partner Grimes announced the arrival of their little
            boy. The pair initially named their newborn child X Æ A-12. The name appeared to be partially inspired by
            one of the songs from 32-year-old Grimes' last album - 4ÆM.</span></p>
