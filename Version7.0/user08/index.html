            <p>
                There are many sports in the world. All of them have merit. All of them offer some sort of positive
                influence on the people who play them. But just as in Lord of the Rings, there is one sport to rule them
                all: soccer (or football, as it was originally and appropriately named – but since I’m in the United
                States, I’ll call it “soccer”).
            </p>



            <p>There is nothing wrong with liking another sport, or even preferring and/or dedicating one’s life to
                another sport. However, it is also okay to acknowledge that it is only fractionally as worthy as the
                sport of soccer.
            </p>

            <p>
                “You are biased.” “You are just saying that because it’s your favorite sport.” I have heard all the
                rebuttals – even from fellow soccer die-hards! But I contest: I like to believe that I gravitated
                toward, then chose soccer as my sport BECAUSE it is better than the others. And not the other way
                around.
            </p>


            <p>In fact, I have played many sports – both organized and informally – throughout my
                life. And there are
                several that I like to play and many that I admire. But at the same time, I have had a number of “a-ha!”
                moments when I realized they were not for me, such as my “What am I doing here?” epiphany playing
                baseball in 8th grade (I hadn’t touched the ball once or broken a sweat, yet I would still have to
                shower when I got home because I was covered in orange dirt).
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to objectively (because there’s no way this is just my opinion, right?) explain why soccer is
                superior to the rest, I present the categories to be assessed:
            </p>

                3. Tactical/decision-making/thinking aspects of sport

                4. Other/miscellaneous aspects (to be specified individually)
