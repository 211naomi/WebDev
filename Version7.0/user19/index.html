    <p>The cards I show show below are the power 5, well actually the power 9</p>

    <p1>The power 9 are stupidly good cards. If you play Magic the Gathering you would know what i'm talking
        about but if you don't.<span id="dots"></span><span id="more"> Magic: The Gathering (colloquially known as
            Magic or MTG) is a tabletop and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield. Released in
            1993 by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro), Magic was the first trading card game and has
            approximately thirty-five million players as of December 2018, and over twenty billion Magic cards
            produced in the period from 2008 to 2016, during which time it grew in popularity.

            A player in Magic takes the role of a Planeswalker, doing battle with other players as Planeswalkers by
            casting spells, using artifacts, and summoning creatures as depicted on individual cards drawn from their
            individual decks. A player defeats their opponent typically (but not always) by casting spells and attacking
            with creatures to deal damage to the opponent's "life total," with the object being to reduce it from 20 to
            0. Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy
            role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, the gameplay bears little similarity to pencil-and-paper
            adventure games, while simultaneously having substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other
            card games.

            Magic can be played by two or more players, either in person with printed cards or on a computer, smartphone
            or tablet with virtual cards through the Internet-based software Magic: The Gathering Online or other video
            games such as Magic: The Gathering Arena. It can be played in various rule formats, which fall into two
            categories: constructed and limited. Limited formats involve players building a deck spontaneously out of a
            pool of random cards with a minimum deck size of 40 cards; in constructed formats, players create decks from
            cards they own, usually with a minimum of 60 cards per deck.
