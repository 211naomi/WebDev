        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Looks: </b>A Centaur is a magical creature whose head, torso, and arms appear to be human and are
                    joined to a horse's body. They are, however, their own individual species, and thus are not
                    half-breeds. Like horses, centaurs can come in a variety of colours, ranging from deep black to
                    white.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <center><img src="images/Firenze.png"></center>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Behavior: </b> Centaurs are not in fact half-breeds, but an entirely different species on their
                    own. They are not very pleased to be insulted, particularly where their lineage is concerned, as
                    Dolores Umbridge found out the hard way. Centaurs are known to be gifted in Divination. Indeed, the
                    centaurs of the Forbidden Forest regularly made vague allusions to seeing the future, as when the
                    centaur Firenze told Harry Potter that they were fated to meet again, and when he and Bane spoke of
                    the "intermission" of sorts, between the First and Second Wizarding Wars. He also mentioned to
                    his class at Hogwarts, that centaurs spend years trying to master their particular art of divining
                    the fates. In 1995, they attempted to murder Firenze for his decision to "enter into human
                    servitude," which was seen as a great and base betrayal. Centaurs also seem to favour nature over
                    technology, the extent of their tools visibly in use being their bows and arrows. Instead, they cast
                    their attention upon reading signs in nature, and living in forests appropriated by the Ministry of
                    Magic. They are territorial creatures by nature, as Rubeus Hagrid mentioned in 1995, upon seeing a
                    herd of centaurs in the Forbidden Forest, whose land was being consistently reduced, and that they
                    might revolt against the Ministry as a result. Later the same year, they proclaimed that even Hagrid
                    was "no longer welcome" within "their" forest, as he had "forfeited the friendship of the centaurs,"
                    and that their "tolerance was waning" (in reference to Hagrid's half-brother, Grawp, whom Hagrid was
                    hiding in the forest at the time). Centaurs do have a sense of honour, being unwilling to harm the
                    young, as the herd within the Forbidden Forest refused to harm Hagrid due to the young Harry Potter
                    and Hermione Granger accompanying him at the time. However, this patience and generosity can wane,
                    as later they saw Harry and Hermione deliberately lead Dolores Umbridge into the forest to "use" the
                    centaurs to eliminate her; this, along the fact that both teenagers are nearing their adulthood, led
                    the herd to attempt to attack the two.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Centaurs do not use wands for magic, but are known to be well-versed in magical healing, Divination,
                    archery, and Astronomy. Centaurs burn herbs such as mallowsweet and sage to refine their stargazing
                    findings. In fact, the centaur Firenze taught Divination at Hogwarts, starting in the 1995–1996
                    school year. They also can perform non-verbal magic while duelling, as shown when Torvus duelled
                    against Jacob's sibling without a wand or an arrow.
