            <h1>Angelo, the Master of Flight</h1>
            <h4>A small story I made up for this project</h4>
            <p class=naz>
                "'<span class=ang><span class=co>My name is Angelo</span>, I find myself in a barren world consisting of floating isles made out of a strange stone that the majority of people call'endstone'. I am a villager trapped in the end. I let everyone else go out before the protal closed but did not make it through in time. The portal closed. I was left here. I can only hope the rest of my group made it out alright. I have no clue what to do now. I have no food and the only possible source of it that I can find are these spiky purple plants, which look kind of like tall grass, hopefully they are edible.Please if you read this... and I'm not here... find me... and help me, please, I beg this of you.</span>' My Lady, this is quite concerning" 
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "<span class=co>Do not worry General Nazoth</span>, This is no threat to us. A stray villager is nothing to be concerned about"
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "But My Lady, if he ate the fruit of these bushes then he would be infected," Said Nazoth, "And that could be dangerous, not just to anyone who enters but it will also be a danger to us if there is someone who has been infected running around causing who knows how much chaos"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "Or it could be an advantage to us, the villagers know much more about tech than us and if he is infected then we might be able to control him and have someone who knows more about tech in the army."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "NO! <span class=co>Amethyst you are the Matriarch!</span> I cannot let you do something that could be this dangerous! I will stop you by force if that is what is necessary to keep you from doing something so foolish! I care about you and cannot let you do this. Please, for the sake of the end, and my heart, do not do this."
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "Look Nazoth, I care too but I believe this is an oppurtunity we cannot pass up. General, I order you to come and help me on my mission! We NEED to find this villager, especially if he is infected with the ender sickness. For the good of everyone and the possible benefit of our army."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "<span class=co>I REFUSE! I WILL NOT LET YOU GO EITHER!</span> You are too important to the survival of The End, I can easily send out troops to do such a task. You shall not go."
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "Do what you like General, but I WILL do this, with or without your aid."
                Amethyst drew her sword and started to move off, searching for this villager with the name of 'Angelo'.
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "NO! Get back here My Lady! I do not want to have to use force to keep you from going on this suicide mission of yours!"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "Well then," Said Amethyst as she looked over her shoulder, "You can come with me or go and get your army to help me search, I don't care which you do but I will not let you use force to keep me from doing this."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "I see. <span class=co>You are determined to do this.</span> Very well. Go. I will follow." Nazoth said as he drew his sword.
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "Good. Now come we must find him quickly. I can feel a force that is near fatal near. We do not have much time left."
            </p>
            <p>
                With this, Amethyst the Ender Matriarch and General Nazoth of the Ender Warriors Faction headed off to try and find this villager named Angelo that was lost in The End.
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "MY LADY!"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "What is it Nazoth?"
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "<span class=co>I found him! But...</span>"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "But what Nazoth?" Queried Amethyst.
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "He's... unconcious... we are to late... WE MUST GET BACK! QUICKLY!"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "NO! There is still time to save him! Just let me come to him and I can work on healing him."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "I... can feel them... encroaching on us... we... must... escape... NOW!"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "We have found him we cannot leave him now. <span class=co>There is still hope for him.</span> Defend while I heal him. I will not leave."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "But My Lady, they are too powerful! I could not possibly hold them off!"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "They are just shades right now, remember? If I heal him then they will grow weaker. Their manfestation in the physical realm is only as strong as the will of an ender infected is weakened. We can save him and stall the rising of the Void King."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "So this has been about trying to stall the Void King this entire time? You know we cannot stop the inevitable once it has started!"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "No this has not been about trying to stall him and I know we cannot stop the inevitable but we can gather more time to prepare. Anyways that is not important right now! <span class=co>We are wasting time!</span> We must not waste any more for I can sense them upon us!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Nazoth drew his sword and started fending off the Void Shades while Amethyst healed Angelo's wounds.
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "Lady are you almost done!"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "Almost, they should be very weak right now. Maybe they can even be harmed and seperated from their physical form."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "Yes, they can be seperated from their physical forms now."
            </p>
            <p class=ang>
                "<span class=co>Wh-what happened?</span> I d-do not feel s-so well." Murmured Angelo.
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "You are safe here," Amethyst consoled, "You are in The End, you were deep in sickness and I have healed you of most of it. Your name is Angelo, right?"
            </p>
            <p class=ang>
                "It... is. The Void... darkness... no pain... ever again... want... fall in... for The King... he will rise!" Angelo Rasped.
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "SEE! <span class=co>He is lost</span>, we should leave him. I do not like this but it must be done."
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "No. I will not leave him. He is not yet lost, not completely healed. I can save him still."
            </p>
            <p class=ang>
                "Please... save me. I do not... want to fall into... this Void. I want to... live. I know... I have become hideous... this infection... just please save me. I will... do anything. I can feel... the clutches... of The King... save me."
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "<span class=co>He is not lost.</span> We must geet him back to the vault to heal him properly."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "But how? He cannot teleport and it is so far... the journey would drain both of us and we would not even make it."
            </p>
            <p class=ang>
                "Wings... flight... in these islands... best travel... available."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "<span class=co>That will not work.</span> We do not have any materials for such a project."
            </p>
            <p class=ang>
                "The shrubs... very stable... versatile material... should work... for basic... gliding... don't let me... fall into the... Void"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "It is better than nothing. Keep a lookout Nazoth, we don't want to encounter any more Void Shades, at least not unprepared."
            </p>
            <p>
                Amethyst makes some basic wings out of the shrubs stems while Nazoth defends her and Angelo.
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "I need to test these quickly before we can start our journey."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "I cannont allow you to test such a contraption My Lady. <span class=co>Let me test them in your stead.</span>
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "I will give you this as you let me drag you into finding this fellow. But I am concerned about you going, be safe, don't die out there."
            </p>
            <p class=naz>
                "I will test this alone because I must. I would give my life for your safety."
            </p>
            <p class=ang>
                Angelo sits up, "Look I know enough about the End and the type of teleportation you use. Teleport your self high up into the air and you should be able to go a long way. Just start with a small jump up for testing. If you get in danger you just teleport up... you don't want to fall into the Void." Angelo collapses.
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "Nazoth go now before I change my mind about you testing the wings."
            </p>
            <p>
                Nazoth launches into the air to make sure the wings work. they allow him to glide safely to the ground.
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "They obviously work, now we need to go. Angelo may start to fade again soon. We must hurry."
            </p>
            <p>
                Nazoth and Amethyst, carrying Angelo in between them, used the wings to glide to the Vault. Their they situated him in the sick bay until he could be fully recovered. Nazoth left to go perform his duties as a general, leaving Amethyst to watch over Angelo.
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "<span class=co>Angelo you are safe now.</span>"
            </p>
            <p class=ang>
                "Thank you, I know that I was a burden to rescue but I am just so grateful someone actually came for me. Would it be possible for me to return to my village when I have recovered? I know this sickness has twisted my body into some sort of hybrid between a villager and one of the ender beings."
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "No, unfortunately you cannot return to your village. You are an ender citizen now. I am sorry."
            </p>
            <p class=ang>
                "I see. I will serve these people then. Tell me... what can I do for this civilitation?"
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "You have displayed a great understanding of flight and our telepotation. I would like it if you could be our new recruit for our army. <span class=co>You would be our Master of Flight</span>, a position I have just realized we do not have but would be beneficial to us. You will start training in combat and teleportation when you recover if you should accept."
            </p>
            <p class=ang>
                "Thank you for offering me a place in your community, I will accept. I would feel lost without a position somewhere now that I cannot go back to my village. I will serve you well."
            </p>
            <p class=ame>
                "Good day then, recruit. I hope you will do our community a great service. You will recover. I know it."
