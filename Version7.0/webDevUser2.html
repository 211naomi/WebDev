			<li>
				<h1>Childhood </h1>
	 			<p> Sir Robert Bryson Hall II was born at 7:36 a.m. in Shady Grove Hospital on January 22, 1990 in Rockville, Maryland. He was born to Robert Bryson Hall, an African-American Maryland native, and a Caucasian mother. Logic spent much of his youth in the West Deer Park neighborhood in Gaithersburg, Maryland. His father suffered from a cocaine addiction and his mother suffered from alcoholism.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h1>Early Career </h1>
                <p> At the age of 13, Logic met Solomon Taylor, who would soon become his mentor. Logic became interested in rap and hip hop after watching the movie Kill Bill: Volume 1, directed by Quentin Tarantino. The film's score was produced by RZA, a member of the hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan. Following this, Logic began listening to the group, and soon expressed a deep affection for hip hop. Logic bought The Roots album Do You Want More?!!!??!, later that year, which prompted Taylor to bring Logic a large number of CDs containing instrumental beats, for him to write lyrics over. In 2009, Logic performed under the stage name "Psychological" with Logic describing the name as "one name that really stuck [with me]."</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h1>Personal Life</h1>
				<p>To properly delve into music as a full-time occupation, Logic terminated a five-year romantic relationship in 2009. He had then stated, "You can put your everything into a relationship, but that doesn't mean you're going to get back what you give. When I created my first mix tape, I realized everything I put in my music — the hours, the lyricism, the time, the grind, pain, sweat, blood, tears — I get it back. I see it."[71] He further commented, saying "The thing is, I feel like so many artists, well, not really artists but so many people think they can rap and they just want a deal and the glitz and the glamour and the women but they don't understand that all I do and want to do is rhyme... I think I've sacrificed so much from my relationships to my friendships to my family; I've literally sacrificed my entire life, and I'm honest." On October 22, 2015, Logic married Jessica Andrea, a singer and Logic's then-girlfriend of two years. On March 20, 2018, he announced that after two years of marriage, he and Andrea had officially separated. He filed for divorce on April 19, 2018. Nevertheless, they remain friends and did not cite anger as the reason for their split.</p>
