<h1>Big dogs are graces of god and I can prove it</h1>
<h2>Reason 1</h2>
    <h3>They Bark, unlike those silly small dogs who yip. Barks are graceful and aren't the most annoying thing on the face of this planet(only beaten by a fork on a ceramic plate).</h3>
<h2>Reason 2</h2>

    <h3>I mean look at this guy how can you not like him, all he wants is a good pat, nothing more, nothing less. Completely constrasting the greed that is shown by small dogs.</h3>
<h2>Reason 3</h2>
    <h3>Big dogs can deter home invaders. Lets be real here, would you expect a small dog to even scare a home invader. No. No you wouldn't, because they can't. They are too weak and do not posses the power of the alpha big dogs. </h3>
