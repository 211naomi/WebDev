<h1> Small dogs are evil viruses of satan and I can prove it</h1>
<h2>Reason 1</h2>
    <h3>They yip, thats about it, I just find it annoying tbh</h3>
<h2>Reason 2</h2>
    <h3>I dont know man i just really dont like small dogs its like they are just trying to be cats but they cant so they just try to compensate for that by being very aggressive and to be honest that kinda scares me. I mean not that much but still to the point where I would prefer to not have one in my house cause they can sometimes be unpredictable you know.</h3>
<h2>Reason 3</h2>
