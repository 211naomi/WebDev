            Large Mouth Bass Information


        </h2>

        <p>

            Both Largemouth and Smallmouth bass are Freshwater fish. They are both carnivoris fish to where they eat
            other fish in the water such as Sunfish, Blue gill, shad and even smaller bass. <strong>Adult largemouth
                bass</strong> are solitary fish, although occasionally several bass will congregate in areas with
            abundant food supplies. They are usually the apex predator in their habitat.
            They will hide between rocks, among water vegetation, or under roots and limbs of sunken trees, striking at
            their prey from the shadows. Bass prefer quiet, calm, and warm water but are very adaptable to other
            conditions. <strong><u>They are found in rivers, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and steams</u></strong>.
            Adult largemouth bass prefer to feed on small fish like perch, sunfish, and minnows. However, they are also
            known to eat crayfish, insects, frogs, and even small aquatic birds. A bass under two inches, known as a
            “fry,” will not act as a predator but instead feed on zooplankton and insect larvae.
            On the other hand, <strong>Small Mouth Bass</strong> are Native to North America, the <strong>Smallmouth
                Bass</strong> is popular game fish sought after by many anglers. Known for the fight it gives when
            getting reeled in, it is considered one of the sportiest freshwater fish. <strong><u>Smallmouth bass are a
                    part of the sunfish family</u></strong>.
            A <strong>smallmouth bass</strong> has an elongated body and is brownish-green in color fading to a
            yellow-white underside. Its sides are covered with dark brown vertical lines while its head has dark brown
            horizontal streaks. The dorsal fin appears to be divided in two, with nine spines on the front part. The jaw
            of a <strong>smallmouth bass</strong> extends to line up with the middle of the eye.
            The eyes of this type of bass are usually red. Male and female bass look almost completely identical, with
            size being the differing factor to observe. Female bass are larger than male bass the same age and females
            tend to live longer than males. Bass grow continually, the larger the fish, the older it usually is. The
            average adult size of a smallmouth is 15-20 inches.
            <strong><u>Spawning occurs in the early spring, when water temperature begins to rise above 60
                    degrees</u></strong>. During this time, the male will build a nest in shallow water above a gravel
            or rock bottom. The female will then drop her eggs and the male will fertilize them. Between 5,000 and
            14,000 eggs will be dropped from the mother. After her eggs are all dropped, she returns to deeper water.
            After about a week,
            the eggs hatch and the male bass cares for them. Together, they will form a school called a “brood swarm,”
            and stay in it for a month. The majority of the newly hatched fry die within this period. The average
            lifespan of a bass that survives the first month is 10 to 12 years.

            Bass Facts </h3>

        <ol><u><strong>Large Mouth Bass</strong></u>
            <li>Extremely young largemouth bass under 2 inches are known as "fry" and feed primarily on zooplankton
                and insect larvae. At 2 inches, they become active predators.</li>
            <li>The largemouth bass has a number of aliases: the widemouth bass, Florida bass, black bass, bigmouth
                bass, bucketmouth bass, green bass, green trout, southern largemouth and northern largemouth.</li>
            <li>A bass’ average lifespan is about 16 years, but have been known to live more than 20 years.</li>
            <li>Largemouth bass have a highly attuned sense of smell, and can zero in on prey by following scent
                trails.</li>
            <li>Adult male largemouth bass are responsible for preparing a nest, usually one to five feet below the
                water. Once the nest is built, a female will lay between 2,000 and 40,000 eggs, which the male will
                stay to guard over a week. When the babies hatch, they stay in the nest for a week.</li>
            <li>The world record bass was caught in 1932 and weighed 22 pounds 4 ounces. In 2009, the same size bass
                was caught in Japan to tie the record.</li>
            <li>The natural predator list for a bass is small. It mainly consists of walleye, muskie, and northern
                pike.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol><u><strong>Small Mouth Bass</strong></u>
            <li>The smallmouth bass has a number of aliases: smallie, red eye, green trout, brown bass, bronzeback,
                and bareback bass.</li>
            <li>Smallmouth bass break the surface of the water and become airborne when hooked, oftentimes even
                performing flips, in an effort to break free.</li>
            <li>Female smallmouth bass are usually larger than male smallmouth bass of the same age.</li>
            <li>Small Mouth Bass reach maturity at the age of three or four.</li>
            <li>The world record bass was caught on July 9, 1955 and weighed 11 pounds 15 ounces and measured 27
                inches in length.</li>
            <li>Bass never stop growing; the larger the fish the older it usually is.</li>
