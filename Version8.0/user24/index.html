                                Welcome! This is the website of Avery Schaefer, world famous Mountain Biker, Ultimate Frisbee player, and sarcasm enthusiest.

                        <h5>
                            To greet you, here is one of my favorite movie monologues. It's from the movie "127 Hours", performed by James Franco.
                        </h5>

                        <article>

                            <p><span class=co>Good morning, everyone! It is 7 o'clock here in Canyonland, USA. And this morning on the boulder, we have a very special guest - self-proclaimed American super-hero Aron Ralston!</span> Let's hear it for Aron. (Audience cheering) Hey! (chuckling to himself) Hi, oh gosh, it's, it's a real pleasure to be here. Thank you. Thank you. Uhm, hey, can I say hi to my Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad! Mustn't forget Mom and Dad, right Aron? Yeah, that's right. Uh, hey Mom. I'm really sorry I - I didn't answer the phone the other night. If I had, I would have told you where I was going, and then, well, I probably wouldn't be here right now. That's for sure! (Audience chuckling) But like I always say, your supreme selfishness is our gain. Thank you, Aron.

                            Anyone else you'd like to say hi to? <span class=co> Uhm, well, Brion at work!...Hey! Uh, I probably won't be making it into work today.</span> (laughing to himself) (Audience laughs too) Get a load of this guy! Oh, wait! Hold on. We've got a question coming in from another Aron in Loser Canyon, Utah. Aron asks, 'Am I right in thinking that even if Brion from work notifies the police, they'll put a 24-hour hold on it before they file a Missing Persons report? Which means you won't become officially missing until midday Wednesday, at the earliest!' Ah, yeah. You're right on the money there, Aron. (Audience laughing) Which means I'll probably be dead by then. Aron, from Loser Canyon, Utah. How do you know so much? (Audience clapping) Well, I'll tell you how I know so much. I volunteer for the rescue service. Hmm? You see, I'm something of a, uh, well, a big f***ing hard hero! (Audience laughs)<span class=co> And I can do everything on my own, you see? </span> I do see. (Audience applauding)

                            Now, is it true that despite - or maybe because you're a big f***ing hard hero - you didn't tell anyone where you were going? Uh, yeah, that's absolutely correct. Anyone? Anyone. Oops! (Audience laughing) Oops. Oops. (sighs)

                            Mom, Dad. I just want to take this time to tell you that the times we've spent together have been awesome. And I haven't appreciated you in my heart as I know that I could. Mom, I love you and I wish that I'd returned all your calls, ever. I love you guys, and I'll always be with you. Yeah.</p>
