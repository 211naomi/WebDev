        <p>
           Two angels, a male and a female, walked into the archangel's chambers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "You have called us," The male said, "What do you need archangel?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, indeed have I called you, Rain and Abigail." The archangel responded.
        </p>
        <p>
            "But why?" Asked the female, Abigail.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You are very impatient, Abigail." The archangel said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I have duties to attend to," She replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Impatience is understanable, but I'm sure your duties can wait." The archangel said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes archangel," She said meekly, "I will try to maintain my impatience."
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is all well. It has been decided that both of you will be relieved of your duties." Said the archangel.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Archangel," Said Rain, "May I ask, why are we being relieved of our duties?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "You two are being relieved of your duties because both of you have been wondering what it would be like to live on the Earth.
            It has been decided that you two will get your wish." The archangel said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "But how did anyone know about that?" Querried Rain.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You forget," Said Abigail, "They know all, nothisn is a secret to any archangel."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You two will be wiped of your memories.
            If you should ever need them they will be restored.
            Upon death you will be able to return here or stay an influence directly on the world." The archangel said.
            Then he raised his hands and light encompassed Rain and Abigail.
            When it faded they were gone and the archangel said, "May peace be with you two as you experience a life on Earth."
        </p>
        <p>
            In a village two children were born. One was named Rain and the other Abigail.
            They lived normal lives, Rain grew to be a young soldier in training and Abigail a mediocre hunter.
            They barely knew each other but both knew when they looked at each other that there was something there.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day Abigail was out hunting when she saw an older girl waking around with a large broadsword.
            "Hey, your!" Abigail called out.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Who's there?" The older girl replied, slightly startled by hearing a voice she couldn't see.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Up here, in the tree," Abigail said.
        </p>
        <p>
            The older girl looked up. "What's a little girl like you doing up in a tree?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I could ask the same about a girl, probably not an adult, that I don't know wandering around this forest," Said Abigail.
            Then she continued, "You're gonna scare all the game away!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I was just passing through," The older girl said, "I didn't mean to scare off any animals."
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's okay," Abigail said with a grin, "From how you're acting it seems like you're one of those players that I hear about."
            The older girl started to walk off.
            "Hey!" Abigail called as she dropped out of the tree and started chasing the older girl, "I didn't mean to offend you!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "You didn't, little hunter," Said the older girl, "I just have places to go."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Could you at least tell me where you are going?" Asked Abigail.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Maybe if you can beat me in a stick fight I will."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sure!" Abigail said gleefully, "I watch the boys in my village train all the time, it can't be that hard."
        </p>
        <p>
            The older girl started to chuckle, "Look, girl," She said, "What's your name?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Abigail."
        </p>
        <p>
            "And I'm Amethyst. So, Abigail, fighting is much harder than it looks, if you still want to try me you can, but I don't reccomend it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm not going to shy away from a duel!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "All right," Amethyst said, laying aside her sword and picking up a stick, "Find a stick that suites you and we'll duel."
        </p>
        <p>
            Abigail found a long stick, roughly the right length to be a staff for a child her size, and quickly trimmed it with her knife.
            Suddenly she lunged at Amethyst, striking a quick flurry of blows that Amethyst barely dodged and parried with her stick, which she used like a sword.
            After the quick flurry at the beginning, Abigail just fumbled with the stick and was quickly bested by Amethyst.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What happened?" Amethyst asked as she helped Abigail up, "You had a very good attack at the beginning but after that you completely failed."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't know," Abigail confessed, "I guess I might have some natural ability with the staff, but I was only able to use it for a small bit."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Look," Amethyst said, staring Abigail straight in the eyes, "Practice, one day I believe you will be an excellant staff weilder, but you need to learn it, understand?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes!" Abigail exclaimed, then ran off to her village.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the village, Rain was sparring with his fellow trainees.
            He was a talented swordsman, just a year from becoming a soldier, even though he was only 10 while most trainess became soldiers at 16.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Trainee Rain!" The training master cried out.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes sir! Training master sir!" Rain responded as he snapped to attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            "To my office, now!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes sir!" Rain replied, then headed to the training master's office. "You called me sir?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, trainee," The training master said, "I'm sorry to say this, but you're going to be held back for a couple years."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sir?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "You are skilled, but you're young.
            You have plenty of potential that I think could be developed to its fullest with a couple more years of training."
        </p>
        <p>
            "But sir-"
        </p>
        <p>
            The captain put his hand up, signalling Rain to stop.
            "I know you are eager to server the village, which is why you will be allowed to instruct those in the village that want to learn about the ways of combat in it.
            We even have someone lined up for you to train."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Who?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "That girl who has supported her family ever since her father died.
            She would like to practice archery and learn how to use a staff."
        </p>
        <p>
            "You mean Abigail?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, she's waiting outside if you want to start training her."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yeah," Said Rain, "I'll go do that." And he walked outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            Abigail had requested training from the village training master, but she didn't expect to get it granted so soon.
            To her surprise Rain walked out of the building.
        </p>
        <p>
            "So," He said, "You want to train in combat?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes," She said, "But aren't you still a trainee?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Training master's orders." He replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Oh," She said, "So you don't want to train me?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I do want to train you, I just couldn't do it if I hadn't been ordered to."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Alright then," Abigail said, slightly embarrased.
            But she perked up again almost immediately, "When do we start?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Right now." Rain replied as he walked over to a rack of weapons.
            He selected tow staffs and tossed on to Abigail, whcih she barely caught.
            "I'm only meiocre with the staff so this should be a fairly good match if you have any skill at all."
        </p>
        <p>
            They sparred for a few hours.
            Rain managed to best Abigail most of the time, but she managed to in turn best him as well a couple of times.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Not bad," Rain said as he put the staffs away, "I would almost think that you had at least some training with the staff at least."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I really have no training or practice whatsoever." Abigail replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Then you are a natural at the staff, just like I am with a sword."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Thanks," She said, "Would you like to come over for supper tonight?
            Me and my mom don't have much, but it's the least I could offer you for being willing to train me."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'd be glad to," Rain replied, "I'll even bring some cheese and vegetables from the training supplies for it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Um, ok, see you later then."
        </p>
        <p>
            True to his word Rain brought cheese and vegetables to Abigail's house for supper.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's very kind of you to train my daughter," Abigail's mom said, "Although I didn't expect her to be trained by someone her own age."
        </p>
        <p>
            "They say I'm a very gifted boy, mam," Said Rain, "I'm the youngest, and also the first, in my class.
            I'm being held back a few years because the training master thinks I could be even better with a few morer years of training.
            As compensasion he is allowing me to train anyone in the village in combat that wants to know about it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's very nice of him." Abigail's mom said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I know mam," Rain replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Come on Rain!" Abigail called from the front door, "I want to practice my archery!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "You'd better go," Her mom said, "She can be impatient sometimes, anyways supper will be a while so you have plenty of time to train her."
        </p>
        <p>
            Rain walked outside, picking up his weapons that were leaning against the outside of the house.
            "Hand me your bow," He said to Abigail, who readily complied.
            He examined the bow carefully then said, "Did you make this yourself?"
            She nodded.
            "Well, it's fairly well built for a homemade one, however I think that we'll need to get a better one for you.
            For now use mine," He said, handing her his bow.
            "Now show me how you hold it."
            She held the bow how she would have normally held hers.
            "I see," Said Rain, "You're holding it in a way so that you don't need armguards."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, I could never afford armguards, so I hold my bow this way." Abigail replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I figured as much, so I brought you some." Rain said as he tossed her some.
            "Now let me show you how to properly hold the bow."
        </p>
        <p>
            He positioned her and made her practice under his watchful eye to get used to the new way of holding the bow until it was time for supper.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You two get along well." Abigail's mother commented.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yeah," Said Abigail, "It's almost like I knew him before."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I did have that odd feeling sometimes, even before we actually met, like I knew you before." Said Rain.
        </p>
        <p>
            They had supper and then Rain prepared to leave.
            Before he left he said to Abigail, "Meet me at the barracks round 09:00 hours. Don't be late, but you're free to be early if that's what you want."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Sure." Abigail replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next morning Abigail arreved at 08:30. 
            Rain was practicing with his sword, fending off multiple other trainees at once.
            When he saw Abigail waiting for him he motioned for the others to stop.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Spar without me."He said to the others, then he walked over to Abigail. "So, you showed up early."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yep." Abigail responded.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, today we're going to start by getting you outfitted with the proper gear, then we'll train.
            Maybe with a few others as well."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Alright."
        </p>
        <p>
            Rain led Abigail to the armory.
            When they walked in he called out, "Angelo, Ashyra, are you here?"
        </p>
        <p>
            A villager swooped over to them on some sort of flying aparatus.
            "I'm sorry Rain, Ashyra is out at the medical center."
        </p>
        <p>
            That's ok Angelo, I'm just getting Abigail here outfitted and wanted some help picking out her gear.
            Also, have you guys managed to finish up your experiment yet?" Rain said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No, it still doesn't work, not yet anyway." Angelo replied.
            "I'd be happy to help you out though, what weapons does Abigail use?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I use a bow and am learning the staff." Abigail said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ah, so that's why you wanted to find Ashyra here Rain?" Said Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yeah, I thought you would be better with the outfitting, but I was hoping Ashyra could help me train Abigail with the staff." Rain replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            "She'll probably be done by the time we've finished getting Abigail the right gear." Said Angelo.
            "So, what kind of staff were you thinking about for Abigail?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Lightweight, about as tall as her."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Got it. And the bow?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Recurve I would think, the arrows should be durable and lightweight as well."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Does she need any armor?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Leather if anything, maybe some iron studs on it for protection, most likely on the gloves but not on the armguards."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Alright, let me measure you Abigail and then I'll be right back."
        </p>
        <p>
            Angelo returned a little bit later with the armor, bow, and a couple of staffs.
            "Here, try these on," He said as he tossed Abigail the armor, which she to put on.
        </p>
        <p>
            "What's that?" Rain asked, motioning towards a staff that looked almost like it could be a spear.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's an old experiment, the thought was that it could lodge into objects and provide better mobility in that way.
            It worked, however Ashyra didn't like it so we put it away for later.
            I thought maybe Abigail could use it." Said Angelo.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I like it," Abigail said as she picked it up, "It feels like it was made for me."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Then you can have it," Said Angelo, "I brought the other one as a starter staff for you."
        </p>
        <p>
            After sorting out what gear Abigail would take, they headed to the medical center, where they found Ashyra, who was healing a bruised trainee.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hey Ashyra." Rain said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Hello Rain, what do you want?" She replied, not turning to him as she said it.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm looking for your help." He said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And what would you need my help with this time?" Ashyra asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm training someone with the staff and hoped you could help me," Rain responded.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And who would that be?" Querried Ashyra.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Me." Said Abigail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ashyra finally turned around.
            Looking Abigail up and down she said, "Well, I guess I could help you Rain, it's not like I have anything much better to do."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Thanks." Said Rain.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Don't be to thankful," Ashyra replied, "You're gonna have to do some sparring against me as well, and not just with your sword.
            I think you could work on your staff skills as well."
        </p>
        <p>
            Rain paled slightly at this, as Ashyra could best him using a staff even when he used a sword.
            "Well I guess we should get started then." He said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every day for the next few weeks they me and trained.
            Abigail got much better with the staff to the point where she could beat Rain whenever he was using a staff.
            Rain also got better with his sword and could almost beat Ashyra with it, but she still managed to defeat him every time.
            Ashyra also trained Abigail for a while in hand to hand combat and using her special staff.
            Angelo came around sometimes to test something with Rain and watch the training.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day as Ashyra showed up she said, "Training is canceled today, the training master wants to see us three in his office now."
        </p>
        <p>
            "What for?" Asked Rain.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I don't know," Ashyra replied, "Some strangers did show up yesterday however, maybe that has something to do with it."
        </p>
        <p>
            They headed to the training master's office where they found him waiting with a couple of other people.
            One of them looked like he had the body shape of an iron golem, while the other one wore a witches hat and mage robes patterned with stars.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am glad you three could show up." The training master said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why have you called us?" Asked Rain.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, I'm not quite sure that I can explain this entirely so I will let Stella here explain." The training master answered.
        </p>
        <p>
            "You three have been called," A voice said, not aloud but in their minds, "Because you three have a certain capacity for magical spells and the like."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Me?" Said Abigail in a confused tone, "I'm just a hunter."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Yes, you my child." The voice 'spoke' again.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And what is that guys business here?" Asked Ashyra as she pointed to the other person in the room.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am a player, who has become lost in this game.
            I was discussing with Arthas here," He nodded at the training master, "How I would like to move in, with my friends, and try to make this village a better place."
        </p>
        <p>
            "That sounds like a good idea," Ashyra said, "We could actually use improvements to our village."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well," Said the training master, Arthas, "I guess your business here is settled IronGolem, you and your friends are free to move in."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Thank you." IronGolem said as he walked out.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That is settled now," Stella said in her weird way, "Let us get to why I want you three here.
            Arthas may have some magic abilities, but I would like you three to travel with me and my band of mages for a while.
            I understand if you don't want to come, however learning magic could help you vastly in combat and healing.
            I know that Ashyra has learned to use her healing powers but they could be improved, and you other two have no clue about your magics.
            They do seem very interesting and I would be glad to explore them with you."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I accept," Said Ashyra, "Travelling the world is something I want to do, there is so much to discover out there!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I will go to," Said Abigail, "Ashyra is teaching me the staff and I have surpassed the level that Rain would be able to train me."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Then I will have to go as well, as I am her teacher." Said Rain.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It is settled then." Stella projected. "We will leave in the morning, go get prepared."
        </p>
        <p>
            As they were leaving Arthas called Rain back. "Yes sir?" Rain said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I'm deciding that you will no longer be held back." Arthas said, "Instead you are graduating earlier than you were even planned to at the rate you were going before."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Why?" Rain asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I've watched you training with Abigail from afar," Arthas responded, "You have improved so much since you started the training.
            You are even almost beating Ashyra, which is a great achievement as when she is sparring against you she uses her magic to boost herself."
        </p>
        <p>
            "I had no clue she was doing that." Rain commented.
        </p>
        <p>
            "And that was her intent, she just makes herself faster so she can block your strikes." Arthas said.
            "some other reasons for me having you graduate now is that you have shown your leadership skills, and the fact that you will learn how to use your magic while travelling with Stella."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Thank you sir for allowing me to graduate early." Rain said.
        </p>
        <p>
            "No problem, Lieutenant Rain." Replied Arthas.
