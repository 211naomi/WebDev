        <h1>Factions</h1>
        <h2>
            The factions of this world seeking to bring peace.
        </h2>
        <div>
            <h4>Golem Gang</h4>
            <p>
                A mixed batch of former players, villagers, and player like characters. 
                They are the main peacekeepers of the Overworld.
                They have settled into a village that was a mix of player like characters and villagers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The End Formation</h4>
            <p>
                The united forces of the End, come together to try and push back the Void from taking over everything.
                They are led by a matriach and have a subfaction within that is their main army.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Ancients</h4>
            <p>
                These are the people that have been around for a long time as sentient pieces of code in Minecraft.
                They do not interfer much in the affairs that happen, but if there is a great peril that will destroy the world they will rise up against it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Ender Warriors</h4>
            <p>
                A subfaction of the End Formation that mainly servers as their military forces.
                They are very diverse in their composition of troops and combat methods.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Villagers</h4>
            <p>
                The villagers of the Overworld are spread out across its vast surface.
                Still they are connected in a faction that helps each other out.
                All villages are connected by their own minecart system so as to provide easy transport between them.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Mystics</h4>
            <p>
                A travelling group of magical misfits that don't fit in with any of the other factions.
                As long as you have magic, trained or untrained, they will welcome you to their faction.
                Little is actually known about what they do however, they are just that mysterious and reclusive.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Naturalists</h4>
            <p>
                These are the creatures of the woods and fields that protect nature.
                There are many different beings in this faction, but they are mainly comprised of elves and werewolves.
                Other notable beings within this faction are the ents and cat people.

        <h2>
            The factions of this world seeking to destroy everything.
        </h2>
        <div>
            <h4>The Horde</h4>
            <p>
                These creatures reign from the Nether and seek destruction of, well, everything.
                Even though they hail from the Nether too, wither skeletons are shunned by the king of the blazing realm.
                The Horde only came to power after the true king of the Nether, NetherGolem, and his wither skeletons were pushed out by Porkington, the current king, and his rebellion.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Glitchlings</h4>
            <p>
                These glitches seem to have an eternal bloodlust and are hard to fight as they will glitch in ways that natural beings of this world aren't supposed to.
                Their leader is a virus given a body by the world.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Void</h4>
            <p>
                A hungering emptiness that craves destruction.
                It is trapped by the End and develops Void shades to try and destroy everything.
                This faction is made up of the Void shades and the king of the Void, Xinshing.
            </p>

        <h1>Characters</h1>
        <h2>
            Profiles on the characters in my series.
        </h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Name: Amethyst</h3>
            <h4>Factions character belongs to: The End Formation</h4>
            <h4>Race: ender/human</h4>
            <h4>Position: matriach</h4>
            <p>
                Once a player in the game, she was pulled into it by unknown circumstances and has now become the leader of the End.
                Also when she was pulled in she was in a field of plants that carried an infection which transformed her into being part ender.
                She wants to go back to being a player but cannot, she even tried to jump into the Void when she realized she was not a player anymore and she was stopped by Nazoth.
                Her weapon of choice is a broadsword that is much larger than her and she wields it with ease.
                She and the one of the tribe leaders, Voltok, have small grudges against each other, even though, or perhaps because, Amethyst is in a higher position of power than him as she is the matriarch of the End.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Name: Rain</h3>
            <h4>Factions character belongs to: Golem Gang</h4>
            <h4>Race: human/angel</h4>
            <h4>Position: lieutenant</h4>
            <p>
                Because of wishes that he had while he was an angel in the distant Skylands he was sent down to earth to live a human life.
                He has no memories of his time as an angel but still retains accelerated skills from the fact that he was one.
                He is a skilled swordsman who can defeat almost any adversary in sparring, or real combat for that matter.
                At the age of 10 he was predicted to graduate from the training facility for his village's army very early.
                However he was held back and told that he could train a young hunter from the village, Abigail, in combat.
                After only a few days of training her with some help from his friends a group of mage showed up in town and requested that Rain, Abigail, and his friend Ashyra wander the world with them and learn magic.
                They accepted the offer and Rain was told that he could graduate and become a lieutenant, which he accepted enthusiatically.
                At some point he fell in love with his apprentice, Abigail, and she with him as well.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Name: Abigail</h3>
            <h4>Factions character belongs to: Golem Gang, The Horde</h4>
            <h4>Race: human/devil/angel</h4>
            <h4>Position: hunter, princess of the Horde</h4>
            <p>
                Because of wishes that he had while she was an angel in the distant Skylands she was sent down to earth to live a human life.
                At around the age of 6 her father left, supposedly dead, and she had to start hunting to keep her and her mother fed.
                One day while she was hunting she found a player walking through the woods.
                After confronting the player Abigail challenged her to a staff duel.
                She put up a good fight at the very start, even though she had no skill with staffs, but was easily beaten by the player.
                The player told her she was naturally talented with the staff, this skill came from her being an angel, and this inspired her to practice the staff in a formal manner.
                When she put in a request for training from the army facility she was assigned a boy her age named Rain as her mentor.
                After seeing that she was naturally talented with the staff Rain took her to practice the staff with one of his friends.
                In trying to locate where she was Rain picked up some gear for her among this being an experimental staff design that she wanted to keep.
                After some days of training a group of mage came into town and requested that she come with them.
                She accepted and with the mages she learned to use her magic to enhcance her weapon.
                Sometime after returning she was hunting in the forest and encountered a pigman, who turned out to be the king of the Nether and her father.
                Her father took her to the Nether where she was crowned the Nether Princess.
                Because of her father she is biologically a devil, even though in reality she is still an angel.
                Recently she started developing horns like her father, however unlike most devils she also started to develop wings.
                These wings were not like an angel's as they were leathery and more bat like, as you would expect if devils had wings.

                A completely misformed entity that bears no resemblance to almost any monster found in the game.
                He rules the Void and seeks to destroy everything that he can.
                His rage is uncontollable and he tries to bring more souls into the Void so he and his monsters can grow stronger.

            <p>
                Ashyra spent a while with the Mystics faction to explore the world and learn better about what she could do with her magic.
                When she left them to go back to the Golem Gang, her home faction, she was told that she would be welcome back whenever and if she ever needed them to just call them with her magic and they would come.
                She is a warrior with many skills.
                During combat she will use her healing abilities to boost her allies' skills by making them faster and stronger.
                While not in combat she will spend her time working on her technological devices or helping to heal the injured.

                When he woke up his survival instincts kicked in.
                Leaving a note for anyone that should come looking for him, he ventured off to find what he needed to survive.
                He did not know what was safe to eat, drink, or even touch in the End so he just guesses.
                Unfortunately this led him to eat a plant that caried an infection which made him part ender.
                He was very weak and being attacked by void shades when Amethyst and Nazoth found and rescued him.
                After that he was given a position in the Ender Warriors for showing them how they could fashion wings out of the natural resources in the End.
                While he had been a member of the Golem Gang he worked with Ashyra to create wings and other mechanical designs for armor and weapons.

                He has sworn his alliegence to the Golem Gang since they started making his village much better.
                Now, in these days, he has pretty much the same position except that the populace of the village turn towards the Golem Gang for advice and leadership.
                He is also considered a paladin because of the fact that he uses magic while in battle.
                Although he mainly uses holy, healing and protection, magics he will also use more necromancy style magic sometimes.

                She is a mute and studies the stars.

                From the stars she takes guidance and gains her powers.
                Her spells are more astral themed, from the ability to illuminate terrain with a giant floating star to burning enemies with solar wrath, she is one of the most powerful mages out there.
                Still this is about all that is known about her as she is at least as secretive as the other members of her faction if not more secretive.

        <h1>World</h1>
        <p>
            The world has five dimensions in it, the Void, the Nether, the Overworld, the End, and the Skylands.
            Their is basically no religion in this world, but there are resemblances of a heaven and hell, which are respectfully the Nether and the Skylands.
            The Nether does not serve as a hell, instead most souls of the dead are absorbed by the Void.
            These souls cannot be used by the Void as they are not usually infected by it.
            However for the creatures that live in the Nether it is a kind of hell for them as they are eternally trapped there and are kept in by the wither skeletons and their king.
            The Skylands do not serve much as a heavan but more as the watchers of the dimensions of this world.
            However a few souls do go here.
            The Skylands are split into two parts that are different from each other.
            The first part is the near Skylands, these are the reachable part of the Skylands and are inhabited by lesser angels that are known as valkyries.
            The second part is the distant Skylands, which are unreachable by all but the angels, not the valkyries, and archangels who usually stay there.
            In the Overworld there are many villages of many sorts.
            Some are inhabited by just villagers, some just by more player like characters, and a few by both of these peoples.
            Werewolves wander the surface of the world, usually not doing much except for the occasional destruction of flocks of sheep or other animals of the like.
            At the center of the world lies a large forest known as Elfheim inhabited by elves and ents.
            Also at the edge of this forest there is a linking tree that links all the worlds together.
            Another tribe that wanders the Overworld are the katties, a race that is much like the werewolves except that they are cats.
