        <center><h1>Reasons I like these things</h1></center>
        
        
        
        <li>I like dogs because they always love you and they are cute. I have two dogs, one is a weimaraner and his name is Murphy, he is very old. His birthday is May 9th and he will turn 15. The second is a german shorthair named Bella, she is 4 years old. </li>
        <ol></ol>
        <li>I like video games because they give me a break from the real world, and they give me a chance to socialize with my friends. I like a variety of video games, and usually ones that are challenging so I can play them longer without getting bored.</li>
       <ol></ol>
        <li>I like youtube because there's always something you can watch from Music videos to funny memes. New videos are being put up every minute, and you can post your own videos too. I have not posted my own yet and not sure that I will. I am a private person so not sure that I want to share all my killer moves on my video games.</li>
